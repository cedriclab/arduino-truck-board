# arduino-truck-board

This is a little project I'm working on with my dad. The idea is to use a BLE-enabled Arduino as a remote connector between a smartphone (see related arduino-truck-android and arduino-truck-ios projects, coming soon) and an electric-powered toy truck.

DISCLAIMER : I'm not a nostalgic person.
